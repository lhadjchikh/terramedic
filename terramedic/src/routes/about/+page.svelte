          What are Warming Stripes?
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Terramedic promotes warming stripes everywhere we go because they communicate the story of
          climate change so powerfully and simply.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Created by climate scientist Ed Hawkins in 2018, warming stripes represent the average
          temperature for individual years, relative to the average temperature over a baseline
          period, typically 1971-2000. Red stripes represent years that were warmer than the
          baseline average, from lighter to deeper tones for the bigger differences. Blue stripes
          show the same for cooler years. Together, they paint the picture of a warming planet.

          The Science Behind the Stripes
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <em>The science is clear, the future is not.</em> - Ed Hawkins
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The data used to create warming stripes comes from multiple scientific sources, including:
          NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NOAA's National Centers for Environmental
          Information, UK Met Office Hadley Centre, and the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature
          project. These organizations maintain long-term temperature records using thousands of
          weather stations around the world, as well as ocean data from ships and buoys. Even with
          slight differences between these datasets, they all show the same overall pattern: a rapid
          warming trend, especially since the 1980s.

          The stripes buttons at Terramedic events help people get involved. The first step is
          wearing one and telling people what it means. The second step is up to you.
